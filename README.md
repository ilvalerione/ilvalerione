## Hi there, Valerio here 👋

I'm a software engineer, CTO of Inspector.dev and creator of [Neuron AI](https://neuron-ai.dev) framework.

Over the last decade, I built software for companies of any size around Europe. 

Then in 2019 I decided to left my high-paying engineering job to pursue my own dream.

I started building Inspector in the second half of 2019, and since then I have not stopped improving the product, building and growing a world class SaaS dev tool starting completely from scratch. Now Inspector is in the technology stack of +1000 software development companies in forty countries.

It was really, really hard to go through this journey, but it's also a fantastic experience technically and personally.

In the last few years as CTO of Inspector.dev I had the opportunity to work on many itneresting projects but [Neuron AI](https://neuron-ai.dev) is far the most challenging and successful. 

The Neuron PHP framework was built to create the AI Bug Fix inside Inspector, because the PHP ecosystem to develop this kind of “AI Agentic” softwares was not as advanced and rich as it is in other technologies. At a certain point we thought it was so great to release it as an open source project. And it was the start of a quite transformative journey for the entire PHP world.

I'm a very quite person, who likes to listen. Feel free to contact me if you think it's a good fit for each other.
